# About
Voxel-Core is a plugin for [Godot](https://github.com/godotengine/godot) made with GDScript, it was created as the ‘core’ for my other project [Voxly](https://github.com/ClarkThyLord/Voxly/projects), offering various VoxelObjects used to display voxels, as well as a in-engine editor.

# Getting Voxel-Core
Since Voxel-Core is not yet in the Godot Asset Library, you must download / clone this repository.


Once you have downloaded / cloned this repository, you will find that the plugin is contained in: `Voxel-Core/addons/Voxel-Core/`
You can move the Voxel-Core plugin folder to your own project’s `addons` folder and activate it in your configuration to use it, you can also import and run the project itself, as it contains several examples of how the plugin can be used.


NOTE: Once Voxel-Core is available in Godot Asset Library, you can download it directly from within Godot through the 'AssetLib' tab in-engine.
